            <p style="color: rgb(12, 12, 12);">Personally, I think this is a work that contains my own thoughts and messages in the most complete and clean way (of course, there are paintings with better messages and compositions than this, but they are still in the storyboard stage). As the name of this work is Bathroom, the characters in this painting are washing their hands with water to wipe off the secretions on their hands after finishing their business in the bathroom. And the mirror there projects another image of the character. Their appearance in the reflected mirror seems a little different from reality, and the black shadows or paint on their bodies symbolize their evil or sin. The person wearing the blue suit can see some of the black stains, but the person who looks like a red-haired student has something black covering him, like the shape of a monster. 
              The person wearing the blue suit looks like an ordinary office worker. The fact that we can see a certain amount of black stains on his body means that every human being has a certain degree of sin or evil. The important thing is, just as he tried to clean off the dirty substances or secretions on his hands with water after doing his business in the bathroom, we, who have committed various sins and evil deeds while living in this world, have to do our best to atone our sins and face the sins. However, the person who looks like that red-haired student may be a perpetrator of school violence. Because even though he has that level of evil, his appearance, smiling as if it's just fun, may not be much different from the strange monster in the mirror. As you can see from these things, the reason why the background of the picture is set as a bathroom is that the bathroom is essentially a place to do business and wipe off dirty substances and secretions from our hands. Additionally, while water is normal in real life, its reflection in the mirror looks like lava. This shows that to atone for and face our sins and evil requires great pain and patience, like washing one's hands in lava. The person in the blue suit is seen washing his hands, but the hands of the red-haired student are not visible to our eyes due to the limitations of the canvas border. The faucet is turned on, but is he really washing his hands? In reality, isn't he just acting (pretending) as if he has atoned for his sins and facing them, and is just smiling and imagining what they will do next without any reflection or introspection?</p>

          <p>Startmore Paper (18 in x 24 in)</p>
          <p>This is a work created based on the theme of the Korean proverb, ‘A frog in a well.’ The meaning of this proverb is to compare a person who does not know the circumstances of the wider world to a frog in a well. In a word, it is a sarcastic comment on a person who has narrow views and thinks only of himself. Inspired by this proverb, I drew a picture of the frog kingdom in the sewer. The king of frogs acts as if he is the best, but if you look at his wardrobe, his crown is a torn paper cup, his necklace is a button, his shoulder and trousers decorations are leaves, and his clothes are nothing more than pieces of toilet paper. As the saying goes, the frog king will look truly pathetic from the point of view of the brothers at the entrance to this sewer.</p>
