            Artist Statement</h2>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            <p style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23);">I am just a 'painter,' a 'writer,' a 'dreamer,' an 'artist,' a 'thinker,' and an 'observer' who wants to share my imaginary world with people through entertainment elements and media, including my own thoughts, lessons, philosophies, messages, and beliefs.</p>
            </p>

            <p>
              <p style="color: rgb(23, 23, 23);">As an artist, I have the ability to draw in various ways, including watercolor, acrylic, oil painting, pen(cil), and digital drawing. Also, I have the ability to weave seamlessly connect the epic narrative, including the story’s central theme, characters, settings, and directing, to create an original IP and philosophy. On the one hand, I have the identity and personality of an observer who considers, witnesses, watches, and observes various things, including objects, people, phenomena, beliefs, changes, and relationships. It is advantageous for drawing diverse works and containing unique messages.</p>
              </p> 

            <p>
              <p style="color: rgb(12, 12, 12);">The first time I seriously wanted to be an artist was when I played a game called the “Pickaxe series.” This game is a free-to-play game created by a two-person development team with a unique and creative setting with a strange and funny story. The game's unique characteristics and narrative made me fall in love with creating something.</p>
              </p>

            <p>
              <p style="color: rgb(12, 12, 12);">For example, I devise my own unique worldview story and include my own messages and questions in my paintings. In other words, due to these experiences, I came to like expression through art, and soon, I wanted to share my thoughts with others by incorporating my own thoughts, values, and beliefs, as well as contents such as lessons or messages in my works. Even if others agree or disagree with my idea. I think that diverse perspectives on a topic are a good thing, regardless of whether they are right or wrong.</p>
              </p>
              
            <p>
              <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Therefore, I express the experiences of wonder and grandeur that I once experienced through symbolic objects, starting with the arrangement of various objects in my paintings, and at the same time share my unique story with others. Because I wanted to let them analyze, consider, and experience my world in their own way. Perhaps this is my desire as an artist.
